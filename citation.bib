    abstract  ="The S66x8 noncovalent interactions benchmark has been re-evaluated at the “sterling silver” level{,} using explicitly correlated MP2-F12 near the complete basis set limit{,} CCSD(F12*)/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12{,} and a (T) correction from conventional CCSD(T)/sano-V{D{,}T}Z+ calculations. The revised reference values differ by 0.1 kcal mol−1 RMS from the original Hobza benchmark and its revision by Brauer et al.{,} but by only 0.04 kcal mol−1 RMS from the “bronze” level data in Kesharwani et al.{,} Aust. J. Chem.{,} 2018{,} 71{,} 238–248. We then used these to assess the performance of localized-orbital coupled cluster approaches with and without counterpoise corrections{,} such as PNO-LCCSD(T) as implemented in MOLPRO{,} DLPNO-CCSD(T1) as implemented in ORCA{,} and LNO-CCSD(T) as implemented in MRCC{,} for their respective “Normal”{,} “Tight”{,} and “very Tight” settings. We also considered composite approaches combining different basis sets and cutoffs. Furthermore{,} in order to isolate basis set convergence from domain truncation error{,} for the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set we compared PNO{,} DLPNO{,} and LNO approaches with canonical CCSD(T). We conclude that LNO-CCSD(T) with veryTight criteria performs very well for “raw” (CP-uncorrected){,} but struggles to reproduce counterpoise-corrected numbers even for veryveryTight criteria: this means that accurate results can be obtained using either extrapolation from basis sets large enough to quench basis set superposition error (BSSE) such as aug-cc-pV{Q{,}5}Z{,} or using a composite scheme such as Tight{T{,}Q} + 1.11[vvTight(T) − Tight(T)]. In contrast{,} PNO-LCCSD(T) works best with counterpoise{,} while performance with and without counterpoise is comparable for DLPNO-CCSD(T1). Among more economical methods{,} the highest accuracies are seen for dRPA75-D3BJ{,} ωB97M-V{,} ωB97M(2){,} revDSD-PBEP86-D4{,} and DFT(SAPT) with a TDEXX or ATDEXX kernel."
